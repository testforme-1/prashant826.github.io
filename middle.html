        He is considered to be one of the greatest players of all time.A chess prodigy, Carlsen achieved second place in the World U12 Chess Championship
		in 2002.At age 15,he won the Norwegian Chess Championship.He surpassed a rating of 2800 at age 18 and reached number one in the FIDE world rankings
		aged 19,becoming the youngest person ever to achieve those feats.Carlsen became World Chess Champion in 2013 by defeating Viswanathan Anand.In the 
		following year,he retained his title against Anand,and won both the 2014 World Rapid Championship and World Blitz Championship, thus becoming the 
		first player to hold all three titles simultaneously,a feat he repeated in 2019.He defended his classical world title against Sergey Karjakin in 
		2016,and against Fabiano Caruana in 2018.He has stated the middlegame is his favourite part of the game as it "comes down to pure chess".His positional
		mastery and endgame prowess have drawn comparisons to those of former World Champions Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, José Raúl Capablanca, and Vasily Smyslov.
